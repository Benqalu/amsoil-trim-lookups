Although AMSOIL recommends the use of either a 5W-30 or 5W-20 motor oil as a default option for this engine, RAM has indicated that 2500/3500 pickups with a gross combined weight less than 14,000 pounds should use a 5W-20 motor oil option. Those with a gross combined weight greater than 14,000 pounds should use a 5W-30 oil. Click here for more options
